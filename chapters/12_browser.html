</blockquote>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_GZ7nJVK3wA" href="#p_GZ7nJVK3wA"></a>The next part of this book will talk about web browsers. Without
web browsers, there would be no JavaScript. And even if there
were, no one would ever have paid any attention to it.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_XT5pNqisw+" href="#p_XT5pNqisw+"></a>Web technology has, from the
start, been decentralized, not just technically but also in the
way it has evolved. Various browser vendors have added new
functionality in ad hoc and sometimes poorly thought out ways, which
then sometimes ended up being adopted by others and finally set down
as a standard.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_ePAQfpo7ra" href="#p_ePAQfpo7ra"></a>This is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it is empowering
to not have a central party control a system but have it be improved
by various parties working in loose collaboration (or,
occasionally, open hostility). On the other hand, the haphazard way in
which the Web was developed means that the resulting system is not
exactly a shining example of internal consistency. In fact, some
parts of it are downright messy and confusing.</p>
<h2><a class=h_ident id="h_MYPczIw5xZ" href="#h_MYPczIw5xZ"></a>Networks and the Internet</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_hsMIYbAKNv" href="#p_hsMIYbAKNv"></a>Computer networks have been around since the 1950s. If you put
cables between two or more computers and allow them to send data back
and forth through these cables, you can do all kinds of wonderful
things.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_rRsGS85yhE" href="#p_rRsGS85yhE"></a>If connecting two machines in the same building allows us to do
wonderful things, connecting machines all over the planet should be
even better. The technology to start implementing this vision was
developed in the 1980s, and the resulting network is called the
<em>Internet</em>. It has lived up to its promise.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_cvrUZPtUxT" href="#p_cvrUZPtUxT"></a>A computer can use this network to spew bits at another computer. For
any effective communication to arise out of this bit-spewing, the
computers at both ends must know what the bits are supposed to
represent. The meaning of any given sequence of bits depends entirely
on the kind of thing that it is trying to express and on the
encoding mechanism used.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_tlYBPgx73H" href="#p_tlYBPgx73H"></a>A <em>network protocol</em> describes a style of communication over a
network. There are protocols for sending email, for fetching email,
for sharing files, or even for controlling computers that happen to be
infected by malicious software.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_u8lDPIC39z" href="#p_u8lDPIC39z"></a>For example, a simple chat protocol might consist of one computer
sending the bits that represent the text “CHAT?” to another machine
and the other responding with “OK!” to confirm that it understands the
protocol. They can then proceed to send each other strings of text,
read the text sent by the other from the network, and display whatever
they receive on their screens.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_WXSVtMixCt" href="#p_WXSVtMixCt"></a>Most protocols are built on
top of other protocols. Our example chat protocol treats the network
as a streamlike device into which you can put bits and have them
arrive at the correct destination in the correct order. Ensuring those
things is already a rather difficult technical problem.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_7IOEk4hhjX" href="#p_7IOEk4hhjX"></a>The <em>Transmission Control Protocol</em> (TCP) is a protocol that
solves this problem. All Internet-connected devices “speak” it, and
most communication on the Internet is built on top of it.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_R1N5wYYFn+" href="#p_R1N5wYYFn+"></a>A TCP connection works as follows: one
computer must be waiting, or <em>listening</em>, for other computers to start
talking to it. To be able to listen for different kinds of
communication at the same time on a single machine, each listener has
a number (called a <em>port</em>) associated with it. Most protocols
specify which port should be used by default. For example, when we
want to send an email using the SMTP protocol, the machine through
which we send it is expected to be listening on port 25.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_C9NFg/yfxC" href="#p_C9NFg/yfxC"></a>Another computer can then establish a connection by connecting to
the target machine using the correct port number. If the target
machine can be reached and is listening on that port, the connection
is successfully created. The listening computer is called the
<em>server</em>, and the connecting computer is called the <em>client</em>.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_g48pTp1IKV" href="#p_g48pTp1IKV"></a>Such a connection acts as a two-way pipe through which bits can
flow—the machines on both ends can put data into it. Once the bits are
successfully transmitted, they can be read out again by the machine on
the other side. This is a convenient model. You could say that
TCP provides an abstraction of the network.</p>
<h2 id="web"><a class=h_ident id="h_tbGTd9Llzv" href="#h_tbGTd9Llzv"></a>The Web</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_w4VQt163Im" href="#p_w4VQt163Im"></a>The <em>World Wide Web</em> (not to be confused with the Internet as
a whole) is a set of protocols and formats that allow us to visit
web pages in a browser. The “Web” part in the name refers to the fact
that such pages can easily link to each other, thus connecting into a
huge mesh that users can move through.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_IX9vl21tDt" href="#p_IX9vl21tDt"></a>To add content to the Web, all you need to do is connect a machine to
the Internet, and have it listen on port 80, using the
<em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> (HTTP). This protocol allows other computers
to request documents over the network.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_KH3H5PXZlk" href="#p_KH3H5PXZlk"></a>Each document on the Web is named by a <em>Uniform Resource
Locator</em> (URL), which looks something like this:</p>
<pre>  http://eloquentjavascript.net/12_browser.html
 |      |                      |               |
 protocol       server               path</pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_0F4MKpLU9B" href="#p_0F4MKpLU9B"></a>The first part tells us that this URL uses the HTTP
protocol (as opposed to, for example, encrypted HTTP, which would
be <em>https://</em>). Then comes the part that identifies which server
we are requesting the document from. Last is a path string that
identifies the specific document (or <em>resource</em>) we are interested
in.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_/GdEX6bncv" href="#p_/GdEX6bncv"></a>Each machine connected to the Internet gets a unique <em>IP address</em>,
which looks something like <code>37.187.37.82</code>. You can use these directly
as the server part of a URL. But lists of more or less random
numbers are hard to remember and awkward to type, so you can instead
register a <em>domain name</em> to point toward a specific machine or
set of machines. I registered <em>eloquentjavascript.net</em> to point at the
IP address of a machine I control and can thus use that domain name
to serve web pages.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_VQIXesk4P9" href="#p_VQIXesk4P9"></a>If you type the previous URL into your browser&#8217;s address bar, it will try to retrieve and display the document at that
URL. First, your browser has to find out what address
<em>eloquentjavascript.net</em> refers to. Then, using the HTTP protocol,
it makes a connection to the server at that address and asks for the
resource <em>/12_browser.html</em>.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_pfUoCDr2pV" href="#p_pfUoCDr2pV"></a>We will take a closer look at the HTTP protocol in
<a href="17_http.html#http">Chapter 17</a>.</p>
<h2><a class=h_ident id="h_n3OM6EV/KR" href="#h_n3OM6EV/KR"></a>HTML</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_m2H1Cp4ACJ" href="#p_m2H1Cp4ACJ"></a>HTML, which stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, is the
document format used for web pages. An HTML document contains
text, as well as <em>tags</em> that give structure to the text,
describing things such as links, paragraphs, and headings.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_P2V14LZFIv" href="#p_P2V14LZFIv"></a>A simple HTML document looks like this:</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_hfCVWJl6ha" href="#c_hfCVWJl6ha"></a><span class="cm-meta">&lt;!doctype html></span>

<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">html</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_zP6SuTzWSr" href="#p_zP6SuTzWSr"></a>The tags, wrapped in angle brackets (<code>&lt;</code>
and <code>&gt;</code>), provide information about the structure of the
document. The other text is just plain text.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_7PI7BADgG4" href="#p_7PI7BADgG4"></a>The document starts with <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>,
which tells the browser to interpret it as <em>modern</em> HTML, as opposed
to various dialects that were in use in the past.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Et3bT2kUby" href="#p_Et3bT2kUby"></a>HTML documents have a head and a body.
The head contains information <em>about</em> the document, and the body
contains the document itself. In this case, we first declared that the
title of this document is “My home page” and then gave a document
containing a heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, meaning “heading 1”—<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>
produce more minor headings) and two paragraphs (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>).</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_twHeUPgGnQ" href="#p_twHeUPgGnQ"></a>Tags come in several forms. An
element, such as the body, a paragraph, or a link, is started by
an <em>opening tag</em> like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and ended by a <em>closing tag</em> like
<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. Some opening tags, such as the one for the link (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>),
contain extra information in the form of <code>name="value"</code> pairs. These
are called <em>attributes</em>. In this case, the destination of the link
is indicated with <code>href="http://eloquentjavascript.net"</code>, where <code>href</code>
stands for “hypertext reference”.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_a6Kx16yoMd" href="#p_a6Kx16yoMd"></a>Some
kinds of tags do not enclose anything and thus do not need to be
closed. An example of this would be <code>&lt;img
src="http://example.com/image.jpg"&gt;</code>, which will display the image
found at the given source URL.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_aDzWCv6pnm" href="#p_aDzWCv6pnm"></a>To be able to include angle brackets in
the text of a document, even though they have a special meaning in
HTML, yet another form of special notation has to be introduced. A
plain opening angle bracket is written as <code>&amp;lt;</code> (“less than”), and
a closing bracket is written as <code>&amp;gt;</code> (“greater than”). In HTML, an ampersand
(<code>&amp;</code>) character followed by a word and a semicolon (<code>;</code>) is called an
<em>entity</em>, and will be replaced by the character it encodes.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_BVTrBS/gKt" href="#p_BVTrBS/gKt"></a>This is analogous to the way backslashes are used in
JavaScript strings. Since this mechanism gives ampersand characters a
special meaning, too, those need to be escaped as <code>&amp;amp;</code>. Inside an
attribute, which is wrapped in double quotes, <code>&amp;quot;</code> can be used to
insert an actual quote character.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_RK6LQEinS9" href="#p_RK6LQEinS9"></a>HTML is parsed in a remarkably
error-tolerant way. When tags that should be there are missing, the
browser reconstructs them. The way in which this is done has been
standardized, and you can rely on all modern browsers to do it in the
same way.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_hnbBzl0NyQ" href="#p_hnbBzl0NyQ"></a>The following document will be treated just like the one shown previously:</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_wP8noGtvgK" href="#c_wP8noGtvgK"></a><span class="cm-meta">&lt;!doctype html></span>

<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">title</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>My home page<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">title</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>

<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>My home page<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>
<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">p</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>Hello, I am Marijn and this is my home page.
<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">p</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>I also wrote a book! Read it
  <span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">a</span> <span class="cm-attribute">href</span>=<span class="cm-string">http://eloquentjavascript.net</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>here<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">a</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>.</pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_6iDhitY04v" href="#p_6iDhitY04v"></a>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags
are gone completely. The browser knows that <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> belongs in a
head, and that <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> in a body. Furthermore, I am no longer explicitly
closing the paragraphs since opening a new paragraph or ending the
document will close them implicitly. The quotes around the link target
are also gone.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_849RpAZtxv" href="#p_849RpAZtxv"></a>This book will usually omit the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags
from examples to keep them short and free of clutter. But I <em>will</em>
close tags and include quotes around attributes.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_YK9xXsU8IZ" href="#p_YK9xXsU8IZ"></a>I will also usually omit the doctype. This is not to
be taken as an encouragement to omit doctype declarations. Browsers
will often do ridiculous things when you forget them. You should
consider doctypes implicitly present in examples, even when they are
not actually shown in the text.</p>
<h2 id="script_tag"><a class=h_ident id="h_x9VDt2sTZZ" href="#h_x9VDt2sTZZ"></a>HTML and JavaScript</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Eruo+DmcTl" href="#p_Eruo+DmcTl"></a>In the context of this
book, the most important HTML tag is <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>. This tag allows
us to include a piece of JavaScript in a document.</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_sp1xCw7ODQ" href="#c_sp1xCw7ODQ"></a><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>Testing alert<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>
<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">script</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span><span class="cm-variable">alert</span>(<span class="cm-string">"hello!"</span>);<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">script</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_3pFG6nbfUJ" href="#p_3pFG6nbfUJ"></a>Such a script will run as soon as
its <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is encountered as the browser reads the HTML. The
page shown earlier will pop up an <code>alert</code> dialog when opened.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_GmDPwY/KfO" href="#p_GmDPwY/KfO"></a>Including large programs directly in HTML documents
is often impractical. The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag can be given an <code>src</code>
attribute in order to fetch a script file (a text file containing a
JavaScript program) from a URL.</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_mNvXGO5FgF" href="#c_mNvXGO5FgF"></a><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>Testing alert<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>
<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">script</span> <span class="cm-attribute">src</span>=<span class="cm-string">"code/hello.js"</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">script</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Hz/JcRYmOp" href="#p_Hz/JcRYmOp"></a>The <em>code/hello.js</em> file included here contains the same simple program,
<code>alert("hello!")</code>. When an HTML page references other URLs as part of
itself, for example an image file or a script—web browsers will
retrieve them immediately and include them in the page.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_DLaR5M/yDv" href="#p_DLaR5M/yDv"></a>A script tag must always be
closed with <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code>, even if it refers to a script file and
doesn&#8217;t contain any code. If you forget this, the rest of the page
will be interpreted as part of the script.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_ztoAMAZEju" href="#p_ztoAMAZEju"></a>Some attributes can also
contain a JavaScript program. The <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tag shown next (which shows up
as a button) has an <code>onclick</code> attribute, whose content will be run
whenever the button is clicked.</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_2Cf2BZ7PG2" href="#c_2Cf2BZ7PG2"></a><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">button</span> <span class="cm-attribute">onclick</span>=<span class="cm-string">"alert('Boom!');"</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>DO NOT PRESS<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">button</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_hBrXiBnQxx" href="#p_hBrXiBnQxx"></a>Note that I had to
use single quotes for the string in the <code>onclick</code> attribute because
double quotes are already used to quote the whole attribute. I could
also have used <code>&amp;quot;</code>, but that&#8217;d make the program harder to read.</p>
<h2><a class=h_ident id="h_xSthu5StoL" href="#h_xSthu5StoL"></a>In the sandbox</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_AniKiqdG2y" href="#p_AniKiqdG2y"></a>Running programs
downloaded from the Internet is potentially dangerous. You do not
know much about the people behind most sites you visit, and they do
not necessarily mean well. Running programs by people who do not mean
well is how you get your computer infected by viruses, your data
stolen, and your accounts hacked.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_D7H4XfnmGB" href="#p_D7H4XfnmGB"></a>Yet the attraction of the Web is that you can surf it without
necessarily trusting all the pages you visit. This is why browsers
severely limit the things a JavaScript program may do: it can&#8217;t look
at the files on your computer or modify anything not related to the
web page it was embedded in.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_KW2fU3B9nm" href="#p_KW2fU3B9nm"></a>Isolating a programming environment in this way is
called <em>sandboxing</em>, the idea being that the program is harmlessly
playing in a sandbox. But you should imagine this particular kind of
sandbox as having a cage of thick steel bars over it, which makes it
somewhat different from your typical playground sandbox.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_7pNt468QvZ" href="#p_7pNt468QvZ"></a>The hard part of sandboxing is allowing the programs enough room to be
useful yet at the same time restricting them from doing anything
dangerous. Lots of useful functionality, such as communicating with
other servers or reading the content of the copy-paste clipboard,
can also be used to do problematic, privacy-invading things.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_0xA5OSkc0i" href="#p_0xA5OSkc0i"></a>Every now and then, someone comes
up with a new way to circumvent the limitations of a browser and
do something harmful, ranging from leaking minor private information
to taking over the whole machine that the browser runs on. The browser
developers respond by fixing the hole, and all is well again—that is,
until the next problem is discovered, and hopefully publicized, rather
than secretly exploited by some government or mafia.</p>
<h2><a class=h_ident id="h_p42hxqLkOm" href="#h_p42hxqLkOm"></a>Compatibility and the browser wars</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_EZKXamx/Cn" href="#p_EZKXamx/Cn"></a>In the early stages of the
Web, a browser called Mosaic dominated the market. After a few
years, the balance had shifted to Netscape, which was then, in
turn, largely supplanted by Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer. At any
point where a single browser was dominant, that browser&#8217;s vendor
would feel entitled to unilaterally invent new features for the Web.
Since most users used the same browser, websites would simply
start using those features—never mind the other browsers.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_VsfVT8QgQV" href="#p_VsfVT8QgQV"></a>This was the dark age of compatibility, often called the
<em>browser wars</em>. Web developers were left with not one unified Web
but two or three incompatible platforms. To make things worse, the
browsers in use around 2003 were all full of bugs, and of course
the bugs were different for each browser. Life was hard for people
writing web pages.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_K5Wu7RrwZS" href="#p_K5Wu7RrwZS"></a>Mozilla Firefox, a
not-for-profit offshoot of Netscape, challenged Internet
Explorer&#8217;s hegemony in the late 2000s. Because Microsoft was not
particularly interested in staying competitive at the time, Firefox
took quite a chunk of market share away from it. Around the same
time, Google introduced its Chrome browser, and Apple&#8217;s
Safari browser gained popularity, leading to a situation where
there were four major players, rather than one.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_ztjPRIOS1D" href="#p_ztjPRIOS1D"></a>The new players had a more serious attitude toward
standards and better engineering practices, leading to less
incompatibility and fewer bugs. Microsoft, seeing its market share
crumble, came around and adopted these attitudes. If you are starting
to learn web development today, consider yourself lucky. The latest
versions of the major browsers behave quite uniformly and have
relatively few bugs.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_4EMPHMJP+U" href="#p_4EMPHMJP+U"></a>That is not to say that the situation is perfect
just yet. Some of the people using the Web are, for reasons of inertia
or corporate policy, stuck with very old browsers. Until those
browsers die out entirely, writing websites that work for them will
require a lot of arcane knowledge about their shortcomings and quirks.
This book is not about those quirks. Rather, it aims to present
the modern, sane style of web programming.</p>
